Height vs Weight Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict a person's weight based on their height. The data used in this project is a small sample of 15 children's heights and weights.

Data Description
The dataset contains two columns:

Height: Height in inches
Weight: Weight in pounds


Steps and Code
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. Data Visualization
     - Plot a scatter plot of height vs weight.
3. Unit Conversion
    Convert heights from inches to meters.
    Convert weights from pounds to kilograms.
4. Linear Regression Model
    Train a linear regression model to predict weight based on height.
    Make predictions using the trained model.
